## Machine Learning Projects
**PROJECTS**
* KNN Classification
    > This project demonstrates the knn algorithm on two different data sets. 
    > The first data set contains two different types of objects as points plotted on x-y plane. 
    > The program identifies the category of a random test point.
    > The seond data set contains images of numbers. The program identifies the number with the help of training data set.
* Face Recognition
    > This project is to recognize a face from the webcam. 
    > First, we have to use the Training program to train the program for faces of different individuals.
    > Then the FaceRecognition program identifies the face being clicked by the web-cam.
* Pokemon Classifier
    > This project is to identify the type of a pokemon from its image.
    > The training and testing data sets have been provided.
